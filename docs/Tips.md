# Tip for ALS-U EPICS IOC Template Generator

## Rules

* `make conf`
This special rule is only valid for the ALS-U EPICS IOC generated by this tool. In order to get the benefit of this rule

```bash
$ source ~/epics/debian-12/7.0.7/setEpicsEnv.bash
$ make conf
```

It will generate one's default `EPICS_BASE` into `configure/RELEASE.local`. It definitely saves time to build IOC quickly.

```bash
$ make conf
>>> Please source setEpicsEnv.bash, if one wants to use this
>>> EPICS_BASE=/home/jeonglee/epics/debian-12/7.0.7/base > ./configure/RELEASE.local

$ cat configure/RELEASE.local
EPICS_BASE=/home/jeonglee/epics/debian-12/7.0.7/base
```
